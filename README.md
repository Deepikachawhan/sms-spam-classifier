# SMS Spam Classifier

![Image Alt]()



The SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning-based project that aims to classify text messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).
The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which contains SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham.

### Features
- Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- Feature Extraction: Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF for transforming text data into numerical features.
- Model Training: Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Evaluation: Model performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### Steps Involved
The project involves the following steps:

- Data Cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant or noisy data from the dataset, such as duplicates, missing values, and incorrect formats.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of labels, message lengths, word frequencies, and other important insights.
- Text Preprocessing: Clean and transform the text data by converting to lowercase, removing special characters, and applying tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- Model Building: Train machine learning models using various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM. Feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF are used.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision to determine the best performing model.
- Improvement: Based on the evaluation results, improve the model by tuning hyperparameters, using more sophisticated models, or applying different feature engineering techniques.
